<p>We're too focused on our donuts to really think about coffee so we've left that up to the locals.  No really
we source our coffee from the best local roasterys and coffee shops in town.  They know their stuff so we leave it up to
th professionals.  We know you're busy too, so we change up our featured coffee of the week so you can tase the best
of the City's flavors without having to go out of your way to get what you like.  Don't worry tho, week keep a house
blend on hand just incase our featured coffee just isnt your cup of joe. </p>
