For a live site please click [Donut Shop Website](https://alexandraschachtner.github.io/bigDD/)

Using:
Normalize
Bootstrap 
JQuery

JQuery is being used to auto collapse the navbar in smaller media screens
JavaScript is being used to offer two different alert messages if the checkbox is checked or not

Divs with the "first, second and contact -container" class responsive 

Note the form elements are not pertanent to the type of input information we would actually be looking for if this were a real site.  Used as place holders.  Please test the check box and submit button for Java Script alerts.

In case it is not obvious the Hamburger has been replaced with Coffee Beans as a style choice for the collapsed version of the navbar
