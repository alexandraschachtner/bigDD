Using:
Normalize
Bootstrap 
JQuery

In case it is not obvious the Hamburger has been replaced with Coffee Beans as a style choice for the collapsed version of the navbar.

JQuery is being used to auto collapse the navbar in smaller media screens
JavaScript is being used to offer two different alert messages and move the user to a new page if check box is clicked or not.  Please test submiting the form with and without checking the checkbox.

Divs with the "first, second and contact -container" class responsive 

Chrome Dev Tools says that navbar is collapsing correctly however, iPad and iPhones do react correctly in real life.  Looking for a fix.  Works as planned on all other devices.
