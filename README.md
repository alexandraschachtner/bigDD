Using:
Normalize
Bootstrap 
JQuery

JQuery is being used to auto collapse the navbar in smaller media screens
JavaScript is being used to offer two different alert messages if the checkbox is checked or not

Divs with the "first, second and contact -container" class responsive 

Please test the check box and submit button for Java Script alerts.

In case it is not obvious the Hamburger has been replaced with Coffee Beans as a style choice for the collapsed version of the navbar

Works as planned on mobile phones, desktop, and landscape view on iPad.  Having troubles with portrat view on ipad with margins hidden behind the navbar and navbar not collapsing correctly.  But only on the iPad and only in portrait.  iPhone seems to be working as planned. 

Image in <h1> is showing up differently in iOS.  Need to look into CSS styling.
